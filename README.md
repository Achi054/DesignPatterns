# DesignPatterns
Quick guide to Design Patterns.<br/>

## Overview
Design patterns represent the best practices. Design patterns are solutions to general problems that are faced during software development. These solutions were obtained by trial and error for quite a substantial period of time.<br/><br/>
Gang of Four (GOF). According to the authors, design patterns are primarily based on the following principles of object orientated design.

- Program to an interface not an implementation
- Favor object composition over inheritance

## Types of design patterns
- <b>Creational Patterns</b><br/>
These design patterns provide a way to create objects while hiding the creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using new operator. This gives program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given use case.
    1. Singleton Pattern
    2. Factory Pattern
    3. Abstract Factory Pattern

- <b>Structural Patterns</b><br/>
These design patterns concern class and object composition. Concept of inheritance is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionalities.
    1. Decorator Pattern
    2. Facade Pattern
    3. Proxy Pattern

- <b>Behavioral Patterns</b><br/>
These design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.
    1. Strategy Pattern
    2. Observer Pattern
